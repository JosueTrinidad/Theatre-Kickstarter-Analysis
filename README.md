# Theatre-Kickstarter-Analysis
Using kickstarter data to perform analysis focusing on theatres.

## Overview of Project
We will review fundraising data that has been gathered using tools found in excel to organize and pull relevant data in hopes to find trends that have failed and succeeded.

### Purpose
The purpose of our analysis is to sort out the large dataset and figure out how we can present the information to Louise where it can be easily understood and utilized. We will then use that information to help Louise organize her own fundraiser, Fever, with a higher chance of success based on similar Kickstarters.

## Analysis and Challenges
The biggest challenge was the overwhelming information that we had. To resolve this I had to organize the information to make sure we can get all the relevant data that is needed to complete this analysis. To help with that I was able to use tools like conditional formatting to visually organize the fundraisers based on factors, like if they failed or if they were successful. I was also able to use formulas to convert dates in epoch format to something that is easier to read. After getting the data organized I was able to extract the relevant data that was needed. Even with just the relevant data it is still a lot of information to digest. An easier way to represent that information would be with charts. For example I was able to to get the total amount of theatre fundraisers that were cancelled, failed and successful and put them together using a pivot table based on dates and goals. From there I was able to convert that information into line charts to help present that information.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first aspect that we focused on was the outcomes of the fundraisers based on the launch date. In this case we were able to figure out how many of the fundraisers failed and how many were successful based on the months they were launched. Looking at the chart it appears the most successful launches were around May and June while the least successful fundraisers were launched in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Another aspect that we looked at was the goal of the fundraiser. Based on the data we were able to determine that goals of $5000 or less would be the most likely to reach that goal. On the other hand, fundraisers that had higher goals would decrease the chance of success. We see that having a goal of $20000, for example, has a success rate of 50%.

## Results
After sorting through all the relevant data we have come to a couple of conclusions that could help Louise with her fundraiser. Looking at the chart that we created it appears that the best time to launch would be during the early summer time, more specifically May and June, since the most amount of successful funraisers were done at that time. Based on the same chart it appears the worst time to start the fundraiser would be in December as the amount of failed and successful outcomes were about the same during that month. Another conclusion we can come to is that having a goal of $5000 or less will have a higher chance of success. 

Now with all that in mind there are some limitations with this data set. For example we have US fundraisers but we dont have specific locations to compare to. We also dont know how the fundraisers were advertised or even the genre of the plays. All those can be factors that could effect their successs.

Some other charts we could have created are the average donations and backers count of cancelled, failed and successful fundraisers. That could give Louise an idea of how many people she would need to donate for her play.
